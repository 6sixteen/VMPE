# Data for VMExplorer
##Data Description
In this case, we measure the area of the white pin section of the circuit board. 
We took **22** images at different angles of the targets or lighting conditions and identify each image with a unique id to distinguish. 
Then we selected **4** parameters from **3** key operators for sampling in the visual algorithm. 
Parameter one is ***thresholdMin*** in operator ***threshold***, and its minimum, maximum and step size are 20, 40, 1. 
Parameter two is ***thresholdMax*** in operator ***threshold***, and its minimum, maximum and step size are 40, 60, 1. 
Parameter three is ***openingCircle*** in operator  ***opeinging\_circle***, and its minimum, maximum and step size are 2, 10, 1. 
Parameter four is ***selectShapeMatrix*** in operator  ***select\_shape***, and its minimum, maximum, and step size are 0.8, 0.84, 0.01.
These parameters are ***representative*** that often appear in measurement algorithms. 
The size of the parameter set for each image is 19845. The accuracy range of the measurement target is 34000-36000 in pixel.
