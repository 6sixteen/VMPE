## Abstraction
Vision measurement becomes a prominent driving force to control product quality in industrial automation with high precision, high efficiency, 
and non-destruction. 
However, designing lighting schemes and optimizing parameters is critical but time-consuming in vision measurement, requiring extensive 
experience for vision engineers. 
It is difficult for engineers to try various parameter combinations in multiple test images to improve measurement quality. 
To address these challenges, we formulate the essential tasks(classification and optimization) and detailed user requirements in 
close collaboration with front-line engineers. 
Further, we design VMExplorer, a visual analysis system based on sampling for exploring parameter space under consideration of different test images.
 We introduce the set theory and propose a weighted Jaccard Index of parameter sets to measure the relationship between two images. 
 An interactive overview with bubbles is provided to depict the classification and the relationship among images. 
 We also design a novel visualization consisting of pixel-based image and heatmap to indicate the pattern in the intersection process of parameter 
 sets. 
 Several intersection orders are suggested to assist users in generating better classification. 
 Furthermore, the parameter relationship is visualized with a matrix-based line chart. 
 Through our system, users can classify the images, understand the parameters importance and the relationship between parameters. 
 We conduct one case study with engineers having different working years to showcase how our system facilitates parameter exploration 
 in vision measurement. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of the proposed approach according to the feedback from the engineers
